# Chromecast Control

## What

Simple application on the raspberry pi to pause a chromecast then rewind 10 seconds on resume so you don't miss any of your show. Triggered by either a TV remote or physical button.

## Why?

Chromecast doesn't make it easy to rewind your show, you have to:
1. Open your phone
2. Open the app
3. Hope that the app shows that the chromecast is still connected
4. Then you get to try to rewind the right amount
    - Some apps give you the nifty -10s and -30s options, but not all do

Instead it's easier to grab the actual TV remote and press `A`. Then to resume simply press `A` again and it will automatically rewind 10 seconds and resume playing. That way you never miss the part of the show that you were distracted from.
